# Windows Subsystem for Linux

To install WSL, see [How to install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

A few additional recommendations:
- Use Windows 11 and WSL2, which won't require any additional configuration or special builds
- Use Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, which is stable and has a large community for StackOverflow questions, etc.
- Make sure to install somewhere that you have ample space (>100 GB, preferably more)
  - You can move the WSL2 distribution, e.g. Ubuntu, after you install if you have to
- Use VSCode for launching work in WSL2
